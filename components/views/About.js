    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Gerald and I'm a 25 year old from Saint Louis, Missouri! I
      always had an interest in technology since I was 4 years old. I like to
      build computers, play video games, and hang out with my friends in my free
      time.

      During Covid-19 I decided to learn a bit about coding and self taught
      myself some during my free time using a Open-Source Curriculum know as
      "THE ODIN PROJECT". Since then I immediately gained a interest and figured
      I should probably enroll in a bootcamp to help me stay on track. I then
      found SavvyCoders. Which through them I learned FullStack WebDev and has
      helped me tremendously to get to were I want to with knowledge.

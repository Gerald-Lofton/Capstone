    <p>My name is Gerald and I'm a 25 year old from Saint Louis, Missouri! I always had an interest in technology since I was 4 years old. I like to build computers, play video games, and hang out with my friends in my free time.</p>
    <p>During Covid-19 I decided to learn a bit about coding and self taught myself some during my free time using a Open-Source Curriculum know as "THE ODIN PROJECT". Since then I immediately gained a interest and figured I should probably enroll in a bootcamp to help me stay on track. I then found SavvyCoders. Which through them I learned FullStack WebDev and has helped me tremendously to get to were I want to with knowledge.</p>
